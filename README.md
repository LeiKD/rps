# rps
A game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors against a computer

## By Donald Komen

## Description
 'rps' was developed during the infamous global Corona Virus Lockdown Period when everybody was forced to stay in their homes as a social distancing measure. It was created to not only aid in conquering the incessant boredom but also to aid in some simple decison maing(In the absence of a coin haha). By playing against a computer, any form of bias is countered.
